Hello and welcome!

I am a PhD research student in the [Social Cognitive Neuroscience lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu) headed under Matthew Lieberman at UCLA.

My research focus is on the interplay of dyadic brain activity during conflict communication, or more simply put the degree of coordination between two individual's brains during real-time communication. Utilizing both behavioral and neural data my main focus of study has been on the determinates of productive cross-ideological communication or communication across political lines. My research has also been applied to couples in conflict, social support, and interpersonal bonding. 

My main modality of neuroimaging used in my research is functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) but I also have experience in fMRI and EEG. 

## Code
Much of my code is free, open-source & well documented with supplementary YouTube videos on [Github](https://github.com/abinnquist). Due to the nascent nature of fNIRS much of my code relates to pre-processing and analysis for dyadic neural data. Below are some examples of the code I have created and adapted:
- [**NIRS pre-processing**](https://github.com/abinnquist/fNIRSpreProcessing) – Current fNIRS pre-processing pipeline for the SCN lab. Can be run manually or with point and click pop-ups.
- [**NIRS dyadic synchrony**](https://github.com/abinnquist/NIRS_dyadic_analyses) – Script for analyzing dyadic conversational data and visualization of the results.
